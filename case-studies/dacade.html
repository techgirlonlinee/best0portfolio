						The UX flow for Dacade.org’s team challenge smoothly guides users
						through forming and submitting teams. Users first receive clear
						prompts directing them to Discord’s dedicated `#teams` channel to
						connect with teammates. Team leaders then enter chosen members'
						usernames on Dacade, automatically triggering team invitations.
						Submission activates only after all members confirm participation,
						enabling the leader to submit a challenge code that links directly
						to all team profiles. This structured yet flexible process
						integrates community-building with platform usability, enhancing
						overall engagement.
