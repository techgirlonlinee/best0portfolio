							Kite is a token bridge that lets users transfer assets across
							blockchains, built as part of a suite of developer tools for
							cross-chain interoperability. The product UI was designed to
							prioritize speed, clarity, and trust—supporting seamless token
							transfers with minimal friction. The interface strips away excess,
							foregrounding the core actions developers and users care about.
							Product was a proof of concept and only released as MVP.

						The design combines high-contrast typography, generous spacing, and
						subtle interaction states to create a lightweight, efficient
						experience. Components are modular and responsive, built around a
						tight grid that keeps the flow consistent from network selection to
						confirmation. The result is a crisp, purposeful UI that supports
						Kite’s positioning as fast, developer-first infrastructure.
