						Designed an airdrop claiming flow that had to account for two types
						of users: those from an EVM chain and those from a non-EVM chain,
						each requiring a different number of steps. The challenge was to
						streamline the experience while handling errors and filtering out
						non-eligible claimers without breaking the flow. The design balances
						clarity with high-energy visuals to keep the experience both
						seamless and hype-driven.
