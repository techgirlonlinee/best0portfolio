							BRICK is a photography studio that embraces minimalism while
							maintaining a human touch. Its identity balances clean, structured
							design with a bit of imperfection, making the brand feel both
							polished and personal. To achieve this, BRICK’s visual style pairs
							a sharp, editorial look with a handmade element, capturing the mix
							of precision and spontaneity that defines the studio.

						The hand-painted “C” is the standout feature, adding a raw,
						expressive detail to the otherwise refined logo. Created through
						brushstroke experimentation and digital tweaking, it was carefully
						chosen to feel natural yet intentional. This small imperfection
						brings warmth to the brand, making it feel more personal and less
						rigid.

						The art direction relies on a sophisticated blend of typography and
						color. Victor Narrow, a high-contrast serif, conveys elegance, while
						GT Flexa Mono adds a structured, utilitarian edge. A neutral palette
						of off-white, silver, and deep black provides a timeless foundation
						that lets the photography shine. This interplay between refined type
						and restrained colors creates a cohesive identity that feels modern
						yet warm, free from excessive digital polish.
