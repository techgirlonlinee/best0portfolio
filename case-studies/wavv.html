							Wavv is designed to make it easier to go offline while staying in
							the loop with friends and community. It’s a lightweight app for
							getting an overview of what friends are up to and broadcasting
							your plans to multiple friends at once—without the distractions of
							social media or endless messaging.

						The app name and design are drawn from analog broadcast wavelengths,
						with the lo-fi aesthetic and generated noise motif reflecting how
						telecommunications were sent. Paired with a greyscale palette, Wavv
						acquires a distinct identity amid a sea of iphone look-alike apps
						while reinforcing our mission to reduce screen addiction and get
						people offline into meeting in real life.

						In the MVP, the UX goal is to make the flow of sharing and checking
						friends’ plans as quick and intuitive as possible. With both actions
						on the home screen—swiping up to see friends’ wavvs or tapping to
						create your own—users jump straight to their intended action.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sending a wavv is designed with privacy and ease in mind. Users can
						create their own or choose from suggested options, helping them
						avoid overthinking or getting stuck. They set a time and select who
						to invite, ensuring only those people see the status and receive a
						notification—giving full control over privacy.

						Wavv targets digital-native Gen Z and Millennials with a casual,
						concise, and intuitive tone—like friends texting. It avoids
						corporate language, keeps messaging direct, and adds personality
						without trying too hard. The copy is confident and actionable,
						without over-explaining or sounding salesy.
