						Centrifuge is a decentralized platform bridging real-world assets
						like real estate and structured credit into decentralized finance
						(DeFi) through asset tokenization. It enables investors to
						transparently pool funds, providing easier access to traditionally
						illiquid markets. Its dashboards emphasize clean, minimal, and
						intuitive design, highlighting key financial data—such as total
						value locked (TVL), APR, asset types, and liquidity
						statuses—supported by detailed visualizations, including line graphs
						and bar charts.
					</p>
					<p>
						These visualizations simplify tracking of investments and pool
						performance, clearly differentiating investment pools by asset type
						and risk level, facilitating quick and informed decisions. Wallet
						and user flows support multiple users, integrating comprehensive KYC
						processes and proxied accounts, visually clarifying roles,
						permissions, and compliance. Strategic use of whitespace, clear
						typography, and consistent color coding (blues, yellows, greys)
						enhance readability and reinforce a trustworthy fintech aesthetic.
