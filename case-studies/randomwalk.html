						The logo reflects probabilistic systems, distributed networks, and
						structured randomness. Inspired by random walk diagrams, the process
						began by sketching out scattered dots representing decentralized,
						non-deterministic movement, evolving into a minimalist, soft,
						organic cluster. The final logo balances abstraction with structure,
						maintaining a polished, data-driven feel that bridges crypto and
						traditional finance.

						Beige is the primary surface color, creating a soft, neutral base
						that feels modern and approachable. Green ties into the finance and
						tech space, offering familiarity, while neon green adds a distinct,
						forward-thinking edge for those in the crypto world. Two sans-serif
						fonts are used—one for titles to add character while staying
						accessible, and another for text to ensure readability.
