						Expanded the visual language to extend to UI screens and designed
						new illustrations for animated motion. The goal was to create an
						airdrop claiming page that also works as a high-energy marketing
						experience—introducing users to a new 'dimension' while giving a
						glimpse of the product’s vibe and potential. The interaction and
						design had to be bold, splashy, and hype-driven.

						Designed an airdrop claiming flow that had to account for two types
						of users: those from an EVM chain and those from a non-EVM chain,
						each requiring a different number of steps. The challenge was to
						streamline the experience while handling errors and filtering out
						non-eligible claimers without breaking the flow. The design balances
						clarity with high-energy visuals to keep the experience both
						seamless and hype-driven.
